What does getCell(int row, int col) return if you pass invalid coordinates like (-1, 5)?
-Since the coordinates are on 3by3 board anything exceeding returns blank space
What does getWinner() return when there's no winner yet?
-Will return blank space since noone has won yet
Explain why getWinner() is marked const but makeMove() is not.
-getWinner() is always on fixed variables that does need to be changed no more, but however on the other hand
makeMove() is the variable that always should be changing to keep the game going
If the board is full but nobody has won, what should isGameOver() return?
-Since its a tie it should return true because the game has already ended without no winner
What value does getCurrentPlayer() return at the start of a new game?
-X, since the game starts with x first
